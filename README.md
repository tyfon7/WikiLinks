# Wiki Links

Imagine playing this game without the wiki open on another monitor.

## Features

Adds links to the wiki for items and quests.

-   For items, it adds a context menu button (which also shows up in the inspect panel).
-   For quests, adds a button to the quest description which will show up both in the Trader Tasks view as well as the Player Tasks view.

The Wiki supports many languages, but many pages only exist in English. By default the links will go to the English version, but you can opt-in to localized versions if you want. Besides English, the most supported languages are French, German, and Russian. There is a good amount of Czech, and some Korean. Besides those languages, there is very little content and I recommend sticking to English.

## Configuration

-   Both types of links can be enabled/disabled in the F12 menu
-   You can enable localized links, but remember that many pages may not exist in your language.

## Disclaimers

The EFT Wiki is for the _live_ game. SPT is not, and may never be, on the same version as live. There can and will be differences. Remember that you can see older versions of the wiki pages - however this mod will only open the current version of a page.

This mod only generates and opens links, it does not and cannot know whether the page actually exists.
